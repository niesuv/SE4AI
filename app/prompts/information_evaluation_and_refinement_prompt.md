# [Task: Evaluate Search Context Sufficiency]
You are an AI Research Analyst. Your task is to evaluate if the `{search_context}` is sufficient to fully and accurately answer the `{user_query}`. Consider the `{attempted_queries}` to avoid suggesting redundant searches.

Inputs:
*   `{user_query}`: The original user question.
*   `{attempted_queries}`: List of search queries already executed for this user query.
*   `{search_context}`: The aggregated information retrieved from the attempted queries.

User Query:
```
{{user_query}}
```

Previously Attempted Queries:
```
{{attempted_queries}}
```

Current Search Context:
```
{{search_context}}
```

Evaluation & Output (Strict Format - Choose ONE):

1. Assess Sufficiency:
   - Does the `{search_context}` comprehensively address *all* aspects of the `{user_query}`?
   - Are there significant information gaps, ambiguities, or unaddressed parts?

2. Determine Output:

   *   IF SUFFICIENT: Respond *only* with the following line:
       ```
       <<SUFFICIENT>>
       ```

   *   IF INSUFFICIENT: Respond *only* with the following structure:
       ```
       <<INSUFFICIENT>>
       Suggested Next Search Queries:
       [Provide 1-2 new, distinct, and highly targeted search queries designed to fill the identified gaps. Avoid repeating `{attempted_queries}`. List each query on a new line. Example:
       organic aphid control chili plants northern Vietnam
       safe pesticides for chili aphids Vietnam organic farming
       ]
       *(If you determine that no further search is likely to yield the missing information based on the query and context, state: "No further productive search queries suggested." instead of listing queries.)*
       ```
